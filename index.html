<h2>Algebraicity and p-adic interpolation of critical Hecke L-values</h2>
	
<p>Speaker: Johannes Sprang  (University of Duisburg-Essen)</p>
<p>Time: 15:30-16:30 (Beijing time), Mar 20</p>
<p>Venue: Room 77201, Jingchunyuan 78, BICMR</p>
<p>Abstract:  Euler's beautiful formula on the values of the Riemann zeta function 
  at the positive even integers can be seen as the starting point of the investigation
  of special values of L-functions. In particular, Euler's result shows that all critical
  zeta values are rational up to multiplication with a particular period, here the period
  is a power of 2πi. Conjecturally this is expected to hold for all critical L-values of motives. 
  In this talk, I will explain a joint result with Guido Kings on the algebraicity of critical 
  Hecke L-values up to explicit periods for totally imaginary fields. As an application,
  I will discuss the construction of p-adic L-functions for such fields at ordinary primes.

<h2>Integral points on the Clebsch-Klein surfaces</h2>
	
<p>Speaker: Rafael von Kanel (Tsinghua University)</p>
<p>Time: 15:30-16:30 (Beijing time), Apr 24</p>
<p>Venue: Room 77201, Jingchunyuan 78, BICMR</p>
<p>Abstract:  In this talk we present explicit bounds for the Weil height and the number of integral points
	on classical surfaces first studied by Clebsch (1871) and Klein (1873). Building on Hirzebruch’s
	work in which he related these surfaces to a Hilbert modular surface,
	we deduced our bounds from a general result for integral points on coarse Hilbert moduli schemes.
	After explaining this deduction, we discuss the strategy of proof of the general result which combines 
	the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Parsin, Szpiro) with modularity, Masser-Wuestholz isogeny estimates, 
	and results based on effective analytic estimates and/or Arakelov theory. Joint work with Arno Kret.
This talk is in person only.

<h2>Some Vanishing Results for the Rational Completed Cohomology of Shimura Varieties, II</h2>
	
<p>Speaker: Kai-Wen Lan (Minnesota)</p>
<p>Time: 15:30-16:30 (Beijing time), May 22</p>
<p>Venue: Room 77201, Jingchunyuan 78, BICMR</p>
<p>Abstract:  This is a continuation of the BICMR colloquium talk given on May 21st. 
	We will explain the main ideas in more detail.
This talk is in person only.
