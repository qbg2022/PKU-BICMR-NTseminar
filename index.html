<h2>Algebraicity and p-adic interpolation of critical Hecke L-values</h2>
	
<p>Speaker: Johannes Sprang  (University of Duisburg-Essen)</p>
<p>Time: 15:30-16:30 (Beijing time), Mar 20</p>
<p>Room 77201, Jingchunyuan 78, BICMR</p>
<p>Abstract:  Euler's beautiful formula on the values of the Riemann zeta function 
  at the positive even integers can be seen as the starting point of the investigation
  of special values of L-functions. In particular, Euler's result shows that all critical
  zeta values are rational up to multiplication with a particular period, here the period
  is a power of 2Ï€i. Conjecturally this is expected to hold for all critical L-values of motives. 
  In this talk, I will explain a joint result with Guido Kings on the algebraicity of critical 
  Hecke L-values up to explicit periods for totally imaginary fields. As an application,
  I will discuss the construction of p-adic L-functions for such fields at ordinary primes.
